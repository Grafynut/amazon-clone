King size comfortably holds a king sized mattress, though it might be a bit difficult to tuck in bedsheets if you also have a mattress protector on the mattress. It's doable but not very easy.The shelves at the headboard are very convenient to keep your phone, bed time books, water bottle on the top, etc.However,the panels that cover the four big storage compartments, don't have hinges. This is quite inconvenient. You have to remove the panel and keep it aside, to do whatever you have to. Also, the tiny opening on each panel given to hold it and lift it, is too small and not polished on the inside, causing blisters if not handled properly. Seems like they have cut costs and have not made it polished, safe and easy to use. But they are charging more than it's worth.", rating: 4 },
